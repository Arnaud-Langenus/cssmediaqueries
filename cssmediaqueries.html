    <h1> A Black Hole </h1>
    <p> A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — no particles or even
        electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it. </p>
</div>
<div class="medium">
    <h1> Event Horizon </h1>
    <p> The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. </p>
</div>
<div class="large">
    <h1> No Reflection </h1>
    <p> In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. </p>
